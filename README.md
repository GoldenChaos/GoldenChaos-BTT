Nifty features:

- Fullscreen button also acts as esc key
- Media controls and iTunes widget disappear when iTunes isnâ€™t running
- iTunes Now Playing widget shows currently playing song or "Paused" if iTunes is not playing anything
- Persistent Next Reminder widget that grabs your next reminder by due date
- Tap on a widget to open its parent app

Requires Location Helper and JSON Helper for weather widget to work properly.

Uses some widgets from https://github.com/vas3k/btt-touchbar-presets and inspired by [this blog post](http://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/). Feel free to add your own widgets via PR, would love to see more supported apps!
