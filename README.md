Nifty features:

- Fullscreen button also acts as esc key
- Date and Time widget toggles Fantastical 2 menu bar when pressed (uses Fantastical 2's default keyboard shortcut)
- Weather widget toggles Carrot menu bar when pressed (uses Carrot's default keyboard shortcut)
- Refresh button appears next to Forward and Back buttons if Safari is open
- Media controls and iTunes/Spotify widgets appear only when iTunes or Spotify is running
- Now Playing widgets show currently playing song or "Paused" if iTunes/Spotify are not playing anything
- Due Today widget shows reminders from Reminders.app that are due today, overdue, or without a due date
- Reminders without a due date persist and automatically show the most recently added reminder
- Persistent Show Finder widget provides easy finder access
- Persistent Maximize Left, Center Window, and Maximize Right controls (with custom glyphs!) for window management
- Tap on any widget to open its parent app
- More context-sensitive widgets coming in the future? Who knows...

Requires Location Helper and JSON Helper for weather widget to work properly.

Uses some widgets from https://github.com/vas3k/btt-touchbar-presets and inspired by [this blog post](http://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/). Feel free to add your own widgets via PR, would love to see more supported apps!
