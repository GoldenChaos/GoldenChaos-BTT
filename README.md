Nifty features:

- Fullscreen button also acts as esc key
- Date and Time widget opens Fantastical 2 mini view when pressed
- Media controls and iTunes widget disappear when iTunes isnâ€™t running
- iTunes Now Playing widget shows currently playing song or "Paused" if iTunes is not playing anything
- Due Today widget shows reminders from Reminders.app that are due today, overdue, or without a due date
- Reminders without a due date persist and automatically show the most recently added reminder
- Tap on any widget to open its parent app
- More context-sensitive widgets coming in the future? Who knows...

Requires Location Helper and JSON Helper for weather widget to work properly.

Uses some widgets from https://github.com/vas3k/btt-touchbar-presets and inspired by [this blog post](http://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/). Feel free to add your own widgets via PR, would love to see more supported apps!
